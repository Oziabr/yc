## Intro

I love to figure out how things works and apply that knowlege to find out simple solutions to complex problems

I trive in situations with limited resouses, which most people finds uncomfortably

I take great pleasure in making stuff works by itself, whatever it may be: a product, a team, a process, an infrastructure, even career of my mentee

I'm making lot of effort to avoid bullshit and micromanagement

My expertize is mostly in software engineering, managing core teams from hire to fire, translating between Business and Tech and advocating for common sence

My current goal is to make personal capital while creating useful stuff

## Accomplisments

- Developed ad-tech product from $100/m MVP to $1M/m in six months (could develop it further, if business haven't ask me to not)
- Doubled project income by simple but clever hacks on few occasions
- My junior fixed infrastructure problem in a few days and without aditional cost, the very same problem four senior engineers was working for months and planning to add $10k/m to the bill

## Other successful projects

- Home ISP + customer support unit in early 2000
- Few Billing system integrations
- Sales automation platform (modularized development, established QA, migrated stack)
- Exploitation and Maintenance platform (MVP and core concepts)
- Internal processes, architecture and devops tuning for various projects
